- Hi, I’m @relic374. I like web development, but I don't have a website because domains cost money
- I’m interested in C/C++ (C ftw), HTML/CSS, gdscript, NodeJS, and Kotlin
- I tried to learn Ruby, but I couldn't understand anything
- I really love bash, so theres a bunch of that here
- I’m currently learning Node.js, Kotlin, and gdscript.
- If you want to collab we can, but I'm busy with school and stuff. Not that I'd know why you'd want to collab with me but...
- To reach me you can email me at: magmis358@gmail.com, which is my alt where my name is Toxman

Thanks for checking this out!
