- I’m interested in C, Python, HTML/CSS, gdscript, and 
- I tried to learn Ruby, but I couldn't understand anything
- I really love bash, so probably will be putting some shell scripts on here soon
- I’m currently learning gdscript and relearning HTML/CSS
- If you want to collab we can, but I'm busy with school and stuff. Not that I'd know why you'd want to collab with me but../
- To reach me you can email me at: magmis358@gmail.com, which is my alt where my name is Toxman
