- Hi, I’m @asgorexe (Relic374). I like web development, but I don't have a website because domains cost money
- I’m interested in C, Python, HTML/CSS, gdscript, and ASM (yes I am totally cool because I like asm)
- I’m currently learning gdscript and relearning HTML/CSS
- I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, sadly
- To reach me you can email me at: magmis358@gmail.com, which is my alt where my name is Toxman
