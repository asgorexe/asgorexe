- I’m interested in C/C++ (C ftw), HTML/CSS, gdscript, rust, and Kotlin
- I tried to learn Ruby, but it was boring
- I really love bash, so theres a bunch of that here
- I’m currently learning C++, gdscript, and I'd like to learn rust
- If you want to collab we can, but I'm busy with school and stuff. Not that I'd know why you'd want to collab with me heh...
